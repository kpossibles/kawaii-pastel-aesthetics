# Kawaii Pastel Aesthetics
## Sublime Text theme for kawaii people

｡･:*:･ﾟ★,｡･:*:･ﾟ☆

Cute, kawaii, and pink theme for Sublime Text, made using [tmTheme Editor](tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com) after realizing that I could only find one cute theme for Sublime by @sailorhg [(Fairy Floss)](http://sailorhg.github.io/fairyfloss/). Not that perfect, but at least it's pink~
